                <div class="background-info">
                    <p>Dr. Fei-Fei Li is a proud innovator in the artificial intelligence industry and machine learning. She was born in Beijing, China in 1976, but moved to the United States when she was 12. She went to Princeton University, where she got her undergraduate degree in Physics while studying other areas in STEM. She went to grad school at the California Institute of Technology and got her PhD degree in electrical engineering.</p> 
                        <br>
                    <p>She is well known for her work on The ImageNet project, this project continues to improve efficiency using AI. Her work not only shapes the future of AI but encourages the future of innovators faced with challenges. Dr. Fei-Fei Li is renowned for her groundbreaking work in AI and computer vision.</p>

                    <h5><em>ImageNet</em></h5>
                    <p>ImageNet is a large scale visual database, that has been hugely impactful in deep learning, but more specifically
                        computer vision research. This includes advancements in object recogniztion and visual understanding, which has
                        big implication in major industries, including automotive, healthcare and security.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Dr. Fei Fei Li set up ImageNet in 2006, at time when most researchers in the field of artificial intellgence put more
                        importance on algorithms than readily available datasets. Dr. Li saw a need to to for these data sets, and was convinced
                        it would make the algorithms more efficient.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After meeting researcher Christiane Fellbaum from Princeton University who was a researcher for WorldNet, Dr. Li decided
                        to use the WorldNet wordbase and heirarchy to launch ImageNet. It has now grown to contain over 14 million annoated images
                        for reseachers everywhere.

                        Dr. Fei Fei Li is a co-founder and board member of AI4ALL a group that is focused on the inclusivitiy, representation,
                        social good and better artificial intellgence. They advocate for diversity in the computer science feild and more
                        specifically the development of artificial intellgence, as without diversity AI models can not accurately reflect society
                        large.

                    <p>
                        AI4ALL's vision also revolves around efficiently using AI to solve social problems to imporve society. The way that they
                        are achieving these goals is by teaching students to solve problems with innovation, and opening the doors between
                        students and researchers all over the globe.
